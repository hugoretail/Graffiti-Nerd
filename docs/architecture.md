# Architecture Overview

Graffiti Nerd is the legacy version, using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The main drawing logic is in a Canvas component with custom spray algorithms.

## Project Migration

For advanced, realistic spray effects and new features, see the new project: **Graffiti Trainer**. It uses modern graphics libraries (PixiJS, Three.js, etc.) and a particle engine for true-to-life graffiti simulation.
