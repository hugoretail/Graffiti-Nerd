# Project Migration: Graffiti Nerd → Graffiti Trainer

Graffiti Nerd is now archived as a legacy project. All new development, including realistic spray, drips, cap types, and advanced features, will continue in the new repository:

## Graffiti Trainer

- Ultra-realistic spray paint simulation
- Advanced particle and edge effects
- Drip, splatter, and cap type options
- Modern graphics libraries (PixiJS, Three.js, etc.)
- Still static-deployable for GitHub Pages

## Why the Change?

Graffiti Trainer is designed to push the limits of realism and training for graffiti art, using the latest web technologies. The original Graffiti Nerd remains as a souvenir and reference for the project’s evolution.
