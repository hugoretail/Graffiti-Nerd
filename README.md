# Graffiti Nerd

This is the original version of the graffiti drawing app, built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It features a simple spray-paint simulation and PNG export, designed for static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages).

## Project Migration

Graffiti Nerd is now archived as a legacy project. All new development, including advanced and realistic spray effects, will continue in the new repository:

**Graffiti Trainer** â€” a next-generation graffiti app with realistic spray, drips, cap types, and more, using modern graphics libraries.

See `docs/migration.md` for details.

## Features (Legacy)

- Spray paint effect (customizable)
- Simple canvas drawing
- PNG export

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build for Static Hosting

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` folder. You can upload this to GitHub Pages or any static host.

## Tech Stack
